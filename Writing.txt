[Game Intro]
Welcome to {game_name}!
This is a game of choice.
You will be prompted when a choice needs to be made.
What is your name, Player?
Well, {name}, we hope you can solve the mystery!

[Scene 1]
The year is 1924.
You have been invited to the party of the year.
You are stood on the street at the address.
A red-faced man in a bowler hat approaches.
Big Joe: Hi Player, I'm glad you could make it!
He leads you to a door around the side.
Big Joe: Welcome to Big Joe's.
The door opens to reveal a glamourous club. 
There are dancing ladies and long counters with thousands of bottles.
Big Joe: For a famous author like yourself, it's on the house!
Lisa Larson: Here, take this drink on the house.
Lisa Larson: Joe's feeling very generous tonight! Might be that deal with Diego.
Lisa Larson: I'm one of Big Joe's best, come watch me sing some time.
A man stumbles into you and slurs incoherently.
He slips into the crowd before you can confront him.
Lisa Larson: That's Clint. Don't mind him, just stay out of his way.
Lisa Larson: Wouldn't want him giving you trouble, now.
...
Suddenly the music cuts out.
Big Joe: I've just received a message.
Everyone is silent, confused and anxious.
Big Joe: Diego is dead.

[Scene 2]
You approach the scene.
The cold night air whips around you.
Fletcher: This here is the spot.
You have approached an alley way.
It's hard to make out the scene in the dark.
