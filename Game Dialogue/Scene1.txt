The year is 1924.
You have been invited to the party of the year.
You are stood on the street at the address.
A red-faced man in a bowler hat approaches.
Big Joe: Hi Player, I'm glad you could make it!
He leads you to a door around the side.
Big Joe: Welcome to Big Joe's.
The door opens to reveal a glamourous club. 
There are dancing ladies and long counters with many glasses.
The cigar smoke hangs thick in the air.
Big Joe: For a famous author like yourself, it's on the house!
Lisa Larson: Here, take this drink.
# CHOICE 1 #
Who are you?
    Lisa Larson: I'm one of Big Joe's best, come watch me sing some time.
No, I don't want a drink.
    Lisa Larson: You might not get another chance at such a cheap night!
    Lisa Larson: Joe's feeling very generous tonight! Might be that deal with Diego.
Thanks a lot! Can I have another?
    Lisa Larson: Alright, then! Luckily Joe's feeling very generous tonight! 
    Lisa Larson: Might be that deal with Diego.
# End of CHOICE 1 #
A man stumbles into you and slurs incoherently.
He slips into the crowd before you can confront him.
Lisa Larson: That's Clint. Don't mind him, just stay out of his way.
Fletcher Finnegan: He's harmless. Just can't handle the drink.
Lisa Larson: Fletch! I thought you'd be working tonight.
Fletcher nods his head in your direction. Missy grabs onto his arm.
Lisa Larson: Fletch works with Missy McLeary. Big Joe isn't a fan.
Fletcher: Mhm.
Lisa Larson: Strange that Missy didn't show up. She likes to scout the competition.
...
Suddenly the music cuts out.
Big Joe: I've just received a message.
Everyone is silent, confused and anxious.
Big Joe: Diego is dead.
