# Dialogue Formatting
In future game versions, will keep dialogue as separate text files to improve readability.
This means importing the files in Game Dialogue and requires formatting rules.
## Formatting Rules
- One line per game dialogue line.
- Use a `#` at the beginning of lines that you don't want to print in the game.
- Use a `=` to indicate a choice (there will usually be one per scene).
- Use a `$` to indicate dialogue and initiate dialogue extracting function.
## Design to Decide On
- [ ] Figure out how to distinguish where choices are made (text symbol?)
- [ ] Figure out how to do dialogue with two parameters - character name and dialogue (symbol and list?)
