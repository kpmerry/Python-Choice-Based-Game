# Documentation
## Game Overview
It will be a murder mystery game, based on a wild west theme. 
Each scene will have a different function, allowing for easy movement between scenes and for the game to progress as it should based on the choices made by the player.
## Characters
There will be a Person Class to denote the characters in the game, a Player Subclass and, in future gameplay, an Enemy Subclass to denote the antagonist in the game. 
## Implementation
The game code will make use of:
- Classes
- Subclasses
- Functions
- User input
- Reading text files
- Custom modules
## Gameplay Ideas
Current ideas to include in the game are:
- mini games in different scenes
- clues to collect that player can print to remind them of their progress
- a weapons class to defend the player against the antagonist
- player stats and objects that increase stats to facilitate more in-depth gameplay (i.e. having a magnifying glass increases perception and allows player to spot clues before moving on)
- a performance metric - timer, scene change count, in-game days/hours/minutes
